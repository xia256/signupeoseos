# Notes

- Original Contract (EOS Mainnet): https://bloks.io/account/signupeoseos
- Modified Contract (TELOS Mainnet): https://telos.bloks.io/account/signuptelos1

To create an account, simply send EOS to the appropriate contract above with a memo formatted as the example below.
This contract stakes and transfers 0.1 EOS for both CPU/NET and uses the remaining EOS to purchase RAM.
At the time of writing this, roughly ~0.5 EOS is required for account creation.

Example memo: `accountname1-EOS8AgDT1hFD699511kaoPAXSpvqMJrngAnqG2JsxEdWUEDLcAC4s`
